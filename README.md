# Deployment

After the first launch the bot will create a `config.json` file with such content:
```json
{
  "Token": "your-token-here",
  "DbAddress": "your-db-address-here"
}
```
You can either launch the bot and edit created file or specify it manually (as first launch argument). If you have specified everything correctly the bot will launch without additional actions.
